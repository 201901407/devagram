This project is being undertaken as a part of the [Semester Long Project(SloP) Program](http://slop.dscdaiict.in/) by DSC, DA-IICT.

The project is aimed to be a Full Stack DevExchange platform which can allow members of the developer community to post news, project showcases and profiles. 

It is aimed to be executed via a complete Agile Software Development Lifecycle, starting with Requirement Elicitation, High and Low level system designs, Wireframe creation,
Development using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, Node, React), end to end testing and deployment via CI-CD. 

The aim of the project is to give contributors a comprehensive idea about the development pipeline in the industry.

There are no 'prerequisites' as such, but you're best off a fast learner, devoted to the job, and determined to see it through, in spite of bugs.
